title: Endosymbionts and Concomitant Predation in Rocky Intertidal Food Webs
summary: Space is extremely limited in the RIZ. Many organisms maximize survival by settling on top of other living things, a process known as epibiosis. But what happens to the epibiont when the host symbiont gets eaten by a predator?

# Epibiosis: Life on Top
In the rocky intertidal, many organisms solve the problem of space-limitation by simply living on top of another organism.
