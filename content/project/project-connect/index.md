title: Project CONNECt
summary: In remote areas of Southern California, camera trap footage suggests that terrestrial consumers are foraging in intertidal habitats. Will coastal development and recreation disrupt this potentially important movement of resources?

# Camera-trap Observation Network for Nearshore Ecosystem Connectivity

![A night rat!](nightrat1.jpg) ![](nightrat2.jpg) ![](nightrat3.jpg)

Project CONNECt uses camera trapping and citizen science to address the role of land-based consumers in connecting coastal terrestrial habitats and adjacent marine systems on the iconic Gaviota Coast in California. Currently our cameras are deployed at the Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve in Lompoc, CA, which represents one of the last large (20,000+ acres) swaths of undeveloped coastal landscape in Southern California. The remote location and inaccessibility of this preserve allow us to assess the relatively uninterrupted movements of terrestrial consumers, including large predators and mesocarnivores.
 
You can help out with this research! We host our images on Zooniverse, a citizen-science website that allows non-scientists to assist with data collection. If you would like to help review images of animals visiting the intertidal, head to our Zooniverse page!
