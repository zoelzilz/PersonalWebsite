abstract: The primary objectives of this report were to understand the likely role, 
  if any, of animals in providing energetic connectivity across ecosystems along the Gaviota 
  coastline of California. This includes identifying thos taxa likely most important to maintaining
  any connectivity, with a focus on connectivity between marine and inland terrestrial ecosystems. 
  We also synthesized existing knowledge on subsidy impacts to evaluate the likely ecological 
  importance of connectivity in this environment, including identifying areas and times where 
  connectivity is likely to be most important.
