I am a graduate student researcher broadly interested in marine food webs, parasitology, and ecosystem connectivity. I am currently a member of both Dr. Hillary Young's and Dr. Armand Kuris's labs at UCSB. In addition to research, I am interested in scientific education, outreach, and applying research on coastal systems to management and conservation.

I study species interactions in Californiaâ€™s iconic rocky intertidal zone. I want to understand not only who eats who, but how understudied interactions like parasitism, mutualism, and epibiosis shape the energy flow in this dynamic, intense environment. My work is deeply centered around a desire to inform coastal management and conservation by studying basic ecological processes.

I first became interested in scientific research at a very young age, telling people at 5 years old that I wanted to be an entomologist. Fast forward 13 years, and I found myself pursuing exactly that path as a bright-eyed undergraduate at UCSB. After four research-filled years in the Kuris Lab, I went on to work various research and education jobs, eventually ending up enrolled as a Masters of Science student at Western Washington University. There, I completed a multi-faceted research project examining the combined effect of ciliate parasites and Sea Star Wasting Syndrome on the ochre star Pisaster ochraceus. Immediately after finishing my Masters research, I decided it was time to return to Santa Barbara and begin a PhD expanding my knowledge of intertidal organisms and their diseases.

If you have any questions about me, my research, or my path to becoming a scientist, feel free to contact me!
